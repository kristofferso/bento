## About
Bento is a platform for sharing and discovering food recipes. 

Features: 
- Automatic parsing of ingredients to recognize amount, unit and ingredient (also works for pasting long lists of ingredients)
- Inline "Slack style" tagging of ingredients when writing cooking instructions for dynamic recipes
- Log in with Apple or password-less by email
- Avatar-generator for recipe creators
- Darkmode support

## Live site
The site can be accessed at https://bentos.netlify.app


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
